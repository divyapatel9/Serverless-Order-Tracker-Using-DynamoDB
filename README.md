# Serverless-Order-Tracker-Using-DynamoDB
A fully serverless application built on AWS to log, store, and monitor customer orders in real time. It uses API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to capture orders, DynamoDB Streams to trigger processing, and stores processed data in S3 with optional email alerts via SNS.
