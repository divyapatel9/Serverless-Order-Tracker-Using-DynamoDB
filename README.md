# Serverless Order Tracker Using DynamoDB

This project is a real-time **serverless order tracking system** built using **AWS services** like DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and SNS. It demonstrates how to collect, process, store, and notify order events in a scalable and event-driven architecture without managing any servers.
